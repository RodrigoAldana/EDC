function dX = dyn_redcho( t,x )
% dyn_redcho: dynamics of the REDCHO protocol internal 
% variables. REDCHO achieves dynamic consensus towards the 
% average of time-varying singlas. 
% EDCHO is recovered by using all g = 0. However, REDCHO with g different
% to zero is robust to spontaneous changes in the network (e.g., connection
% or disconnection of nodes).

function dX = dyn_modulated_redcho( t,x )
% dyn_modulated_redcho: dynamics of the REDCHO protocol internal 
% variables with modulation function. This version achieves dynamic 
% consensus towards the average of time-varying signals in a prescribed
% time. Test signals are always persistent signals of the form A*cos(w*t).

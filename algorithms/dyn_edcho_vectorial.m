function dX = dyn_edcho_vectorial( t,x )
% dyn_edcho_vectorial: dynamics of the EDCHO protocol internal 
% variables. EDCHO achieves dynamic consensus towards the 
% average of time-varying singlas. Test signals are always persistent
% signals of the form A*cos(w*t). 
%
% This version of the protocol (vectorial) is the "compact"
% implementation of the protocol, where the incidence matrix
% is used. The result is (algebraically) identical to the 
% other version in dyn_edcho_components.m

function dX = dyn_edcho_vectorial( t,x )
% dyn_edcho_vectorial: dynamics of the EDCHO protocol internal 
% variables. EDCHO achieves dynamic consensus towards the 
% average of time-varying singlas. 
% This version of the protocol (vectorial) is the "compact"
% implementation of the protocol, where the incidence matrix
% is used. The result is (algebraically) identical to the 
% other version in dyn_edcho_components.m

function dx = dyn_edcho_components( t,x )
% dyn_edcho_components: dynamics of the EDCHO protocol internal 
% variables. EDCHO achieves dynamic consensus towards the 
% average of time-varying singlas. Test signals are always persistent
% signals of the form A*cos(w*t). 
%
% This version of the protocol (components) is the straightforward
% implementation of the protocol, where each agent adds the 
% correction terms per neighbor.

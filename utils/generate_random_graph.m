function [adjacency,laplacian,incidence] = generate_random_graph(N,p)
% generate_random_graph: Generates a random undirected graph which is guaranteed to
% be connected.
% INPUTS:
%       N: Number of nodes
%       p: connectivity in the interval (0,1].
%          p near 0, means more disconected, p=1 means fully connected.
%          for p < 0.05 the funcion may not terminate. 
%          Interval p in [0.1 , 1] is recommended.
% OUTPUTS:
%       adjacency, Laplacian and Incidence matrices for the graph.

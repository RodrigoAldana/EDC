function print_progress( t,inter,percentage_step,time_step )
% print_progress: Prints percentage of progress for a ode0 
% or other methods whose progress is meassured with respect to a time
% variable running over an interval with a fixed step.
% INPUTS:
%       t:               current time value.
%       inter:           vector containing initial and final times.
%       percentage_step: refers to "how often should progress
%                        be printed? every 1%? every 5?".
%       time_step:       refers to the fixed time step at which the time
%                        variable is expected to increase.

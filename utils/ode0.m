function [t,x] = ode0(sys, inter,x0,h)
% ode0 : Euler method implementation of differential equation solver
% INPUT:
%   sys:   function which computes dx/dt as a function of x,t. i.e. dx/dt =
%          sys(x,t)
%   inter: time interval to obtain solution
%   x0:    initial condition
%   h:     discretization time step

function kappa = modulating( t , m)
% modulating: modulating function of order m
% call modulating( 'init' , m) to initialise the function parameters
% which are essentially polynomial coefficients
% After that just call modulating(t/T) (vector friendly) which is a 
% curve kappa starting at kappa(0)=0, ending at kappa(T)=1 and with 
% its first m derivatives vanishing at t in {0,T}.
